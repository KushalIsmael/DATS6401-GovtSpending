# Government-Spending-Visualizations

## Description
This was the first project for George Washington University's DATS 6401 - Visualization of Complex Data course. I had to create visualizations using the Google Visualization API to analyze the difference of government spending by country and its population on healthcare, military, and education. The visualizations were embedded in a Bootstrap webpage hosted on GitHub pages.

Data for the project was cleaned and combined using Excel and Python. The final datasets were stored in a Google Sheet.
